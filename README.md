# Hex-Explorer
This is a fairly simple program that might prove useful to anyone unfamiliar with the 16 million or so colours available to them when programming in any computer language that uses the hexadecimal numbers to represent the three colour components of the RGB system.  

Each colour component has 256 different values (from 0 to 255) and can be 'mixed' together to make pretty much any colour in any shade or hue that you could want.  

Originally made as a learning exercise for me to see how straightforward or not it was to program in QML and use the Ubuntu SDK. 

Rewritten now using Qt Quick Controls (the intention was to not require using 'Ubuntu Components 1.3' but I've used them for the 'i18n.tr()' translations for now anyway) which should make it easily portable to other platforms with minimal changes.

Packaged using 'Clickable' (which has been very nice and straightforward to use) for the Ubports/Ubuntu Touch platform.
