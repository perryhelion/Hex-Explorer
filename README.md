# HexExplorer

Move the sliders, see the colours, read the hexadecimal representation.

This is a fairly simple program that might prove useful to anyone unfamiliar with the 16 million or so colours available to them when programming in any computer language that uses the hexadecimal numbers to represent the three colour components of the RGB system.

Each colour component has 256 different values (from 0 to 255) and can be 'mixed' together to make pretty much any colour in any shade or hue that you could want.

Originally made as a learning exercise for me to see how straightforward or not it was to program in QML and use the Ubuntu SDK.

Rewritten now using Qt Quick Controls instead of 'Ubuntu Components 1.3' (although still present to make use of 'i18n.tr()' functions) which should theoretically make it more easily portable to other platforms.
